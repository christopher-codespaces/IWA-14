// To correct the code, some mistakes in the syntax of the function declarations were corrected. Additionally, the multiply function was changed to perform multiplication instead of subtraction. The internal function was also updated to correctly calculate the sum of the addition and multiplication of the a and b values stored in the internal object, and return the result. Finally, the console.log() function was used to print the results to the console.
